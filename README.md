## Description
**AsciiFlow** is a Python library designed to bring life to the console with animated ASCII shapes. It provides a simple yet powerful tool for creating and displaying ASCII animations in your comٰmand-line interface. Whether you are adding a fun element to your scripts or creating engaging tutorials, **AsciiFlow** makes it easy to integrate dynamic text and shape animations.

## Features

## Requirements
- Python 3.x

## Installation
You can install **AsciiFlow** by cloning this repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/samnodehi/asciiflow.git
```
Navigate to the directory where you cloned AsciiFlow and you can run the script directly or integrate it into your own Python projects.

## Usage
To get started with AsciiFlow, you simply need to import and run the module in your Python script. Here’s how you can quickly set it up:

1. Import the library:
   ```python
   import asciiflow
   ```

2. Call the main function to start the animation:
   ```python
   asciiflow.main_loop()
   ```

This will start the interactive text and shape animation loop. Follow the on-screen prompts to customize the text and observe the shape animations.

## Example
Here is a simple example of how to use AsciiFlow in your script:
